# AWS CLI Security Demo

## Overview

The **`awscli-security-demo`** project is designed to showcase best practices for securing AWS resources using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). This demo provides practical examples and scripts that illustrate how to implement security measures, manage permissions, and monitor activities within your AWS environment.

## Features

- **IAM Role Management**: Create and manage IAM roles and policies to enforce the principle of least privilege.
- **S3 Bucket Security**: Configure S3 bucket policies, enable versioning, and set up logging for auditing purposes.
- **Security Groups**: Control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances by configuring security groups.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Enable AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging API calls and resource usage.
- **Encryption**: Utilize AWS KMS and S3 Server-Side Encryption to protect sensitive data.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: You will need an active AWS account to use the services demonstrated in this project.
- **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface. You can follow the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).
